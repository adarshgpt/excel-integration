#### Steps to follow in integrating WPT with Excel

##### 1. Setting up a java project.
  * WPT API Key, Get yours from here [WebPageTest API Key](https://app.webpagetest.org/ui/entry/wpt/signup?enableSub=true&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=slackbot&utm_content=account)
  * Clone this repository.
  * Update ngrokUrl in application.properties file (ngrokurl="")
  
  
 We have currently two APIs to serve requests
* /submittest: This is used to submit the test on WebPageTest.
* /testresult: Internally this API is used to fetch test results and ping back once result is ready.
  
  Note: We are using ngrok to setup a public URL against your localhost(e.g.8080) which is then used as a pingback URL followed by /testresult.

##### 2. Making locally running server publicly accessible
 * Install and start ngrok
 * After installing ngrok run "ngrok http 8080"
 * This returns public URL which forwards request to localhost(e.g. 8080), on which our server is running.
 * Now our server is publicly accessible by the URLs returned by ngrok.

##### 4. Creation of Excel sheet
 * Create a new Excel file(.xlsx) "Book1.xlsx" and save it under 'D:' drive (taking example of windows). I've used "Book1" as name for the excel sheet.

 * OK, you’ve created it! Now, please make sure you have two sheets("RequestSheet", "ResultMetric") inside your excel file.

 * "RequestSheet" will contain 'test-Urls', 'API-Key', 'Location'. 
 
 * "ResultMetric", this sheet will be used to populate the test results. Mention your test request data from 'median' view of json result e.g. chromeUserTiming.CumulativeLayoutShift, SpeedIndex, TotalBlockingTime(upto 7 cells in ResultMetric sheet).

 * After setting up everything as mentioned above, then hit /submittest as a "POST" request from postman or by any other means.
   E.G. - > http://localhost:8080/submittest/

 * Once all these things are done and submitted, you will get your desired results in your "ResultSheet" once pingback url has successfully captured test results
